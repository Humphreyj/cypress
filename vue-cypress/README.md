## Project setup

This is a simple Vue app developed to help refine a set of best practices for Cypress testing. It needs the `simple-express-server` found in this repo to work properly.

### To get started

Clone the project and in your terminal run
`npm i` and then `npm run dev`

Thats it!

### Test Credentials

If you followed the setup instructions you can access the application with either:
`username: testman`
`password: test123!`
or
`username: admin`
`password: admin123!`
